### Summary

Neural Networks play a crucial role in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML), significantly impacting areas like image recognition and predictive modeling. Traditional Neural Networks rely on discrete layers, which can be inefficient for solving complex or continuous-time problems. The Universal Approximation Theory states that these networks can approximate any continuous function, but they may do so inefficiently. To address these limitations, Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (Neural ODEs) have been introduced. They model hidden state dynamics in a continuous manner, allowing for greater adaptability in computational depth. Additionally, Neural ODEs improve memory efficiency by calculating gradients in real-time, negating the necessity to store all activations during training. However, the comprehension of Ordinary Differential Equations can be intricate, and the application of Neural ODEs may not be suitable for all types of problems.
